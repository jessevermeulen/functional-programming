# Functional Programming

## Introduction to the course
Functional programming is part of a 6-week-long elective module of the Information Design semester. The goal for this [CMDA-TT](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/) course is to learn about cleaning data by writing functional code, document the ongoing process and reflect on the results.

### Deliverable
Cleaning and reformatting [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) data by using functional patterns.

### The client
The topic of this project is ‘the car in the city’, which got assigned to us through a collaboration between [the Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a well-known Dutch quality newspaper with over 400.000 subscribers, and CMDA-TT.

## Research

During the length of this project I'll be focussing my research on vehicles, in specific: vehicles registered in the Netherlands. The required data is publicly accessible through different APIs, see [Sources](#Sources) for a summary of all data providers.

## Interesting research subjects

- If parking within city centers becomes too expensive, what place(s) would be most cost-efficient to park a car while still being able to reach the city center within an acceptable amount of time?
- Do cities offer enough infrastructure for camper vans, for example: to empty grey water tanks, refill drinking water tanks, resupply gas tanks for cooking and to charge portable batteries?
- If the import of fossil fuels from foreign countries falls short, what would be the impact on our society?
- If all cars would be fully electrical, what changes to our infrastructure would be needed to fulfill the demand for power? (Thanks to Robert Spier)
- Hypothetical speaking, if I would need to park my 3-meter-high horse trailer, what parking facilities offer me high enough ceilings to safely park my vehicle?
- With the constantly changing laws regarding environmental zones, what vehicles are/aren't allowed to enter an environmental zone?

### Research question
**What vehicles are registered in the Netherlands?**

Sub questions

- What fossil fuel type is most used by vehicles, and is there a shift observable to other fuel types or electricity?
- What consumer vehicle brands are most present on Dutch roads?
- What electric vehicle options are available to buy and what range do they have?
- How many vehicles are registered as a taxi
