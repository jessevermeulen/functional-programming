<h1 align="center">Functional Programming</h1>

Functional Programming is part of the [CMDA-TT](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/) tech track, a 6-week-long elective module consisting of 3 courses: Functional Programming, [Frontend Data](https://github.com/jessevermeulen/frontend-data) and Frontend Applications. With Functional Programming we get to learn how to write functional code, document the ongoing process and reflect on the results.

Cleaning and reformatting [RDW](https://rdw.nl/) data by using functional patterns. | The topic of this project is ‘the car in the city’, a project which got assigned to us through a collaboration between [the Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a well-known Dutch quality newspaper with over 400.000 subscribers, and CMDA-TT.

## Research

During the length of this project I'll be focussing my research on data about parking facilities. The required data is publicly accessible through different APIs, see [Sources](#Sources) for a summary of all data providers.

### Research question
Since parking within cities becomes more expensive and so less accessible for most people, we have to look to other options to park a car while visiting a city.

**If parking within city centers becomes too expensive, what place(s) would be most cost-efficient to park a car while still being able to reach the city center within an acceptable amount of time?**

#### Sub questions

- What parking options are available within and outside city centers?

*Assumption:* Parking facilities within a city center are mostly located underground, while facilities outside a city center aren't.

- How much does it cost to park a car, what differences in pricing are noticeable while comparing parking facilities inside and outside city centers?

*Assumption:* It's more expensive to park a car within a city center, it's also generally speaking not possible to park a car for a longer period of time.

- What can we say about parking facilities further away from city centers, are they located closely to e.g. train stations and car pool locations?

*Assumption:* I'd expect to find a lot of parking facilities which are in close proximity of public transport.
