## Research questions

- With the rapid development and greenification of public transport, are the amount of available parking spaces for cars decreasing or increasing? -> With the available data it's not possible to do further research about this matter.
- With the increase of electric cars on the road, do parking facilities facilitate enough charging points?

## Interesting subjects

- Electronic vehicles
- Parking facilities with charging points
- Public charging points (external dataset)
- Proximity amenities (CBS)
