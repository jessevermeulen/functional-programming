# Functional Programming

## Introduction to the course
Functional programming is part of a 6-week-long elective module of the Information Design semester. The goal for this [CMDA-TT](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/) course is to learn about cleaning data by writing functional code, document the ongoing process and reflect on the results.

### Deliverable
Cleaning and reformatting [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) data by using functional patterns.

### The client
The topic of this project is ‘the car in the city’, which got assigned to us through a collaboration between [the Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a well-known Dutch quality newspaper with over 400.000 subscribers, and CMDA-TT.

## Research

During the length of this project I'll be focussing my research on vehicles, in specific: vehicles registered in the Netherlands. The required data is publicly accessible through different APIs, see [Sources](#Sources) for a summary of all data providers.

### Research question
**What vehicles are registered in the Netherlands?**

Sub questions

- What fossil fuel type is most used by vehicles, and is there a shift observable to other fuel types or electricity?
- What consumer vehicle brands are most present on Dutch roads?
- What electric vehicle options are available to buy and what range do they have?
- How many vehicles are registered as a taxi?
