# Functional Programming

## About the course
The goal for this [@CMDA-TT](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/) course is to learn about cleaning data by writing functional code, document the process and reflect on the outcome.

### Deliverable
A digital data visualisation based on [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) data, and possible other datasets from other providers.

### The client
This course consists of a 6-week-long project which is assigned to us by [the Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a well-known Dutch quality newspaper with over 400.000 subscribers.

## Research
During the time span of this project I'll be researching data about 'cars in cities'. In specific, data about the electrification of vehicles including its necessary infrastructure.

### Research question
With the increasing amount of electric vehicles on road, do parking facilities offer enough infrastructure like charging hubs?
