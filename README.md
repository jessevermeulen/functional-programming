# Functional Programming

## About the course
The goal during the [@CMDA-TT](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/) Functional Programming course is to learn about cleaning data by writing functional code, document the process and reflect on the outcome.

### Deliverable
A digital data visualisation based on [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) data.

### The client
This course is part of a 6-week-long project which is assigned to us by [the Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a well-known Dutch quality newspaper with over 400.000 subscribers.

## Research


During the length of this project I'll be researching data about 'cars in cities'. In specific, data about electric vehicles including its necessary infrastructure.

### Research question

#### Version 1
> With the increasing amount of electric vehicles on road, do parking facilities offer enough infrastructure like charging points?
>
> #### Sub questions
> - How many electric vehicles are currently registered in the Netherlands?
    - [Open Data RDW: Gekentekende_voertuigen_brandstof](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Voertuigen/Open-Data-RDW-Gekentekende_voertuigen_brandstof/8ys7-d773)
        - Brandstof omschrijving (endpoint)
> - How often do electric vehicles need to be recharged?
    - If granted access: [Elektrische Voertuigen Database](https://ev-database.nl/blog/ev-database-data-services/), otherwise: [Cijfers elektrisch vervoer](https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2020/10/Statistics%20Electric%20Vehicles%20and%20Charging%20in%20The%20Netherlands%20up%20to%20and%20including%20September%202020.pdf)
    - [Verkeersprestaties personenauto's; kilometers, brandstofsoort, grondgebied](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS&tableId=80428ned&_theme=483)
> - How many charging points are parking facilities offering?
    - [Open Data Parkeren: SPECIFICATIES PARKEERGEBIED](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)
        - ChargingPointCapacity (endpoint)
